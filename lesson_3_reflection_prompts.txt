When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To save the file permenantly.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I need to change the local files, so I need to decide when to sync them in appropriate time.
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork: make a your own repo on server side, you can do anything on it. You can not push you change back to original repo.
    clone: just get a local copy, you can not put your own code back to repo if no permission.
    branch: split to a new workspace for some change, could merge later.
    
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I need to make some change, and don't like to destroy current state.
